## For my first API project I decided to work with NASA's API that provides access to their Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)

## View NASA's current or recent APOD by selecting a date

## I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project

## NASA's APOD API: https://github.com/nasa/apod-api

## If forking repo, be sure to grab your own API key here! https://api.nasa.gov/
